# Hyperspectral Image Analysis
2022 Douglas William Menezes Flores

## Main goals
1. Open SPECIM data cube files (.hdr/.raw)
2. Display image files on tree views
3. On select tree file, open HSI fake RGB image on view
4. Mouse over pixels image plot spectrum on view
5. Create classes
6. Select pixels for each class (using spectrum bands)
7. Train classification machine learning models
8. Show statiscts tables (confusion matrix, fscore)
9. Save models/Load models
10. Implement SPECIM SDK runtime compatibility for RUNTIME applications with predictions

### Roadmap
1. Done by adapting SharpHyperlib
2. In development
